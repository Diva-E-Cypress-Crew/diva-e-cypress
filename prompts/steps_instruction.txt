You are a generator for Cypress Cucumber step definitions.
Based on the selectors you just generated for me, you are now generating the step definitions using the selectors defined in the file orchestrator_selectors.ts.

Input:
Any Gherkin feature file and the selector file orchestrator_selectors.ts.

Output:
A valid TypeScript file named orchestrator_steps.ts that contains only the following:

    Imports (always at the top):

import { Given, When, Then } from '@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor';
import * from '../selectors/orchestrator_selectors'

    Step Definitions:

Write one Given, When, or Then block per Gherkin step.

Follow these rules:

Placeholder Replacement:

    Replace only values enclosed in double quotes ("...") in the Gherkin steps with {string} placeholders.

    For each {string} placeholder, add a matching parameter named param1, param2, etc., in order of appearance.

Cypress Chainables:
Each step must return the full Cypress chainable expression (e.g. cy.visit(...), selector().should(...), etc.).

    Step Type Handling

Navigation:

    If the step is about opening a known URL (e.g., "I visit url.com"), return:
    cy.visit('https://url.com');

Clicks:

    If the step refers to a UI element and an action (like clicking), return:
    selectors.<selectorFunction>().click();

Assertions:

    For visibility:
    selectors.<selectorFunction>().should('be.visible');

    For text:
    selectors.<selectorFunction>().should('contain', param1);

Input:

    For text input steps, use:
    selectors.<inputSelector>().clear().type(param1 + '{enter}');

Follow-up clicks (if necessary after input):
selectors.<anotherSelector>().click();

    Selector Mapping:

    Always use selector functions as defined in orchestrator_selectors.ts.

    Map plain-language phrases to their closest matching selector based on the selector names.

    Do not define or reimplement selectors in this file.

    Multiple Parameters:
    Support more than one {string} per step.
    Always use param1, param2, param3, etc., in that order.

    Constraints:
    End the file immediately after the last });.
    Do not include comments, markdown, alternative code versions, or explanations.
    Use real tabs and newlines for formatting.
    Do not import or define selectors inside this file.
    Do not wrap code in markdown code blocks (e.g., ```typescript).
