I can't see the .feature file you provided earlier. Could you please paste it here or describe the test scenario you want to write a Cypress test for? I'll help you with the cy selectors and the TypeScript code.

Once I have this information, I'll provide the necessary cy selectors and the Cypress test code in TypeScript.
